Answer the following questions and write out the answers without the units. You may round your answers.<br />
	<br />
	<br />
	<br /> 
  
  1. Dry air is passed over hot copper until all the oxygen has reacted. dry air copper heat
The volume of gas at the end of the reaction is 120 cm3.


	<br />
	<br />
  What is the starting volume of dry air?
  	<br />
	<br />
  	<br />

2. How many neutrons are presented in atom X. Atom X has a protn number of 21 and a nucleon number of 45.
	<br />
	<br />
  
<br />
  3. Hydrogen peroxide H-O-O-H decomposes to form water and oxygen.  
  <br />
	<br />Hydrogen peroxide H-O-O-H decomposes to form water and oxygen. 
	<br />
	<br />
  The reaction is exothermic. The following are the bond energies:
  <br />
	<br />
  Bond:                Bond energy in kJ/mol
  <br />
O-H :                    +460
<br />
O-O:                    +150   
<br />
O=O:                   +496
<br />
<br />
What is the energy change for this reaction?
	<br />
	<br />
	<br />

  4.How many neutrons are present in atom Z?(Atom Z has a proton number of 54 and a nucleon number of 133)
  	
<br />

	<br />
